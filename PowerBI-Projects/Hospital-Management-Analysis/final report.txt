1. Dataset Creation:
We will create a dataset with 20 columns and 1 lakh rows, including details about:

Patients: ID, Age, Gender, Admission/Discharge Dates, Diagnosis, Treatment, Satisfaction Score.
Hospital Services: Doctor Assigned, Department, Treatment Type, Room Type, Total Bill Amount, Medication Costs.
Operational Data: Payment Methods, Insurance Providers, Wait Times, Feedback Scores, Emergency Visits, Appointment Cancellations.
Demographics and Branch Data: City, Hospital Branch.
2. Data Cleaning Steps:
Planned Steps for Cleaning:
Remove Duplicates: Identify and eliminate duplicate rows.
Handle Missing Values: Fill missing values with appropriate substitutes (e.g., median for numerical, mode for categorical).
Standardize Data: Convert text to proper case, remove extra spaces, and standardize categories (e.g., Male/Female).
Correct Date Formats: Ensure date fields are consistent and correct any mismatches.
Validate Numerical Values: Check for outliers or incorrect values in columns like Age, Bill Amount, etc.
Fix Data Types: Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., Satisfaction Score to integer).
Create Derived Columns: Add columns like "Length of Stay" calculated from Admission/Discharge dates.
Remove Irrelevant Data: Eliminate columns/rows that donâ€™t add value to the analysis.
3. Visualizations:
We will create a dashboard with meaningful insights using these visuals:
