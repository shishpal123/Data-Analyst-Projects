Data Storytelling for the Walmart Sales Analysis
Our project aimed to analyze Walmartâ€™s 2024 sales data to identify trends, customer behavior, and actionable insights for improving business operations in 2025. Here's the story we derived from the data:

1. Key Insights from the Analysis

Customer Purchase Behavior:
Certain customers, like Joe Trump and Sarah Wilson, were frequent buyers, contributing significantly to the revenue. However, most customers made single or infrequent purchases.
Action: Reward loyal customers with personalized discounts or loyalty programs to retain them and encourage repeat purchases.
Regional Performance:
South and Midwest regions contributed the most to total sales, while Northeast showed lower performance.
Action: Increase inventory and promotional activities in high-performing regions while investigating and addressing challenges in the underperforming Northeast region.
Product Category Insights:
High-performing categories: Smartphones (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro Max, Samsung S23) and Laptops.
Low-performing categories: Apparel and Snacks had lower sales and profit margins.
Action: Focus marketing efforts on top-selling categories and reassess pricing or cost structures for underperforming ones.
Discount Impact:
Products with discounts between 3%-5% showed the highest profitability, while higher discounts often reduced profit margins.
Action: Optimize discount strategies to strike a balance between sales volume and profitability.
Order Status Analysis:
8% of orders were returned, with higher return rates in the Apparel category.
Action: Review quality or customer expectations for frequently returned categories and provide better product descriptions online.
2. Shortcomings in the Business

Low Customer Retention:
The majority of customers were one-time buyers, indicating low retention.
Solution: Introduce customer retention strategies like loyalty rewards, subscription services, or targeted marketing campaigns.
Uneven Regional Growth:
Some regions, like the Northeast, underperformed despite having a large customer base.
Solution: Conduct surveys or research to understand region-specific challenges, such as logistics or product availability.
High Returns in Specific Categories:
Categories like Apparel had a higher rate of returns, likely due to mismatched expectations or quality concerns.
Solution: Improve product descriptions, provide size guides, and offer better quality checks.
Underperformance in Non-Electronics Categories:
Categories like Snacks and Apparel contributed less to overall revenue.
Solution: Invest in marketing campaigns for these categories or consider expanding product ranges.
